# PoF_Simulation

This repository contains the code to simulate PoF system, implementing some algorithms of decisions in order to experiment with differents behaviour of the system.

## Features
* Execute legacy algorithm for PoF (developed with MATLAB and converted to Python)
* Save simulation data (csv, plots and experiment data)
* Execute the simulator headless
* System ready to do batch simulations

## Execute Simulator

1. Go to file: ``run_simulator.py``
2. Configure simulator and input_parameters
3. Execute the simulator with function `execute_simulator`
